// TODO(adam):
//
// Grab repository and forks, traverse each branch collecting commits
// dedup commits, but grab new commits, show if they're ahead of mainline,
// can be merged, how big they are, summary, etc
//
// Besides forks, search for commit hashes in mainline across Github, Gitlab, etc
//
// Web UI with button to cherry-pick commit into PR on the mainline.
